I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto conducting machine learning research on Bayesian methods for big data.
Much of my work has involved scaling Gaussian Processes, as well as discrete latent variable models, and deep latent variable models.
I am an inherently curious individual with a diverse range of interests and I like dabbling in new fields and applications.
If you are interested in collaborating on an application, please reach out to me! <br />

# Teaching
I have been a teaching assistant in 12 engineering undergrad and graduate courses at the University of Toronto. 

**Coming soon ...**  <br /> 
During the winter 2019 term I will be co-instructing a new 3rd year Engineering Science course *ROB313 Learning from Data* alongside Prasanth B. Nair.

# Engineering
## D3ACE
I am the lead developer for the library D3ACE which is currently being used in ongoing jet-engine development programs at Pratt & Whitney Canada.
D3ACE contains a suite of Bayesian machine learning models for design exploration and optimization.

## Atlas Human-Powered Helicopter
Developed a Human-Powered Helicopter which won the Igor I. Sikorsky prize; the third largest monetary prize in aviation history at $250,000 which stood unclaimed for 33 years.
See the record breaking [video](http://bit.ly/11fClAv)!
I led the design, optimization and construction of the massive 20m x 20m x 4m helicopter structure.
I was the lead test pilot and I hold the FAI world endurance record. [Video](https://bit.ly/2NyaxAy).
Our small team of 6 engineering students and graduates manufactured all components in-house.
