# About
I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto conducting machine learning research on Bayesian methods for big data.
Much of my work has involved scaling Gaussian Processes to large datasets, however, I also work on discrete latent variable models as well as deep latent variable models.
I am an inherently curious individual with a diverse range of interests and I like dabbling in new fields and applications.
If you are interested in collaborating on an application, please reach out to me!
