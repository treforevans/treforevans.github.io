I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto conducting machine learning research on Bayesian methods for big data.
Much of my work has involved scaling Gaussian Processes to large datasets, however, I also work on discrete latent variable models as well as deep latent variable models.
I am an inherently curious individual with a diverse range of interests and I like dabbling in new fields and applications.
If you are interested in collaborating on an application, please reach out to me! <br />

# Teaching
I have been a teaching assistant in 12 engineering undergrad and graduate courses at the University of Toronto. 

**Coming soon ...**  <br /> 
During the winter 2019 term I will be co-instructing a new 3rd year Engineering Science course *ROB313 Learning from Data* alongside Prasanth B. Nair.
