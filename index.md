I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto conducting machine learning research on Bayesian methods for big data.
Much of my work has involved scaling Gaussian Processes, as well as discrete latent variable models, and deep latent variable models.
I am an inherently curious individual with a diverse range of interests and I like dabbling in new fields and applications.
If you are interested in collaborating on an application, please reach out to me! <br />

Developed a practical inverse aerodynamic shape optimization design process to achieve highly laminar flow bodies with an optimal pressure recovery.
Using this process, I designed Eta, a vehicle that I later built with AeroVelo, and which currently holds the world speed record at 144.17km/hr on a flat road!

# Teaching
I have been a teaching assistant in 12 engineering undergrad and graduate courses at the University of Toronto. 

**Coming soon ...**  <br /> 
During the winter 2019 term I will be co-instructing a new 3rd year Engineering Science course *ROB313 Learning from Data* alongside Prasanth B. Nair.

# Engineering
## D3ACE
I am the lead developer for the library D3ACE which is currently being used in ongoing jet-engine development programs at Pratt & Whitney Canada.
D3ACE contains a suite of Bayesian machine learning models for design exploration and optimization.

## Atlas Human-Powered Helicopter

Our team AeroVelo, a small team of 6 engineering students and graduates, developed a Human-Powered Helicopter which won the Igor I. Sikorsky prize; the third largest monetary prize in aviation history at 250,000 USD which stood unclaimed for 33 years.
I led the design, optimization and construction of the massive 20m x 20m x 4m helicopter structure which is currently on permanent display at the Ontario Science Center.
I was the lead test pilot for the aircraft and I hold the FAI world endurance record for human-powered helicopter flight.

## Eta Speedbike
<img align="right" style="max-width: 500px; height: auto; " hspace="10" src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5500421ce4b028ce8ab9d39c/t/57fb17e1ff7c5085cbe52604/1476073665068/?format=1000w">
Developed a high-speed Human-Powered land vehicle that travelled at 144.17 km/hr on a flat road to break the world land-speed record.
For [my undergraduate thesis](files/undergrad_thesis.pdf), I developed a practical aerodynamic shape optimization process to design Eta's highly laminar flow body (see [my blog post](http://www.aerovelo.com/mission-log/2015/7/24/aerodynamic-design-of-eta)). 
Conducted other extensive research projects including structural and aero-structural optimization to design the vehicle's frame and wheels. 
Our small team of 3 to 6 people manufactured all components in-house.
